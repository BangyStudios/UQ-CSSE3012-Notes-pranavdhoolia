### Research
- With the introduction of new products in the market daily, customers today have numerous choices when it comes to using a particular product.
- And yet, only a handful of products succeed in securing a large customer bases, and this is because they take the time to understand what their customers want.
- Almost all companies can have data on their customers, but data often fails to communicate the frustrations and experiences of customers.
- A positive customer experience promotes loyalty and helps retain customers
- For a product to meet the expectations of its consumers, we need to find out the exact way a consumer uses the product.
- And we also need to gain an understanding of how this experience develops over time.
- According to a report by Hubspot, [80% of customers](http://www.salesforce.com/resources/articles/customer-expectations/) consider their experience with a company to be as important as its products.

- This is where the customer journey comes into place.
- Customer journey tells us about the customer's behavior during pre-purchase, consumption, and post-purchase stages of a product.


- simply understanding the customer journey isn't enough. It's best to visualize this complicated journey into a diagram that the company employees can refer to as a resource. This is where designing a customer journey map comes into play.

- A customer journey map is a visual representation of a customer’s experience with a company. 
- It provides an understanding into the needs and concerns of potential customers which directly motivate or inhibit their actions. 
- This information allows companies to boost customer experience leading to higher conversion rates and improved customer retention.
- Design teams use customer journey maps to see how customer experiences meet customers’ expectations and find areas where they need to improve designs.

___
- A customer journey map is simple and has a few components, which I will now explain in detail.
	- **User Actions** are the various ways customers might use a product. It details what a customer does in each stage of the process.
	- If the process is long or complicated, customers might *feel a range of emotions* at every stage. 
	- We should always aim to mitigate negative **emotions** about the journey so that they don’t become negative opinions about the brand.
	- The stages at which the customer is experiencing negative emotions are called **pain points**.
	- The main goal of the customer journey map is to identify pain points in the buying process and eliminate them.
___
- So **how do we make a customer journey map?** There are a few simple steps that need to be followed for that.
	**Step 1:** Set clear objectives for the map. A few things you could think about are:
		- What goals are you directing this map towards? 
		- Who is it specifically about? 
		- What experience is it based upon?
	**Step 2:** Make personas representing your target customers
		- A persona is a fictional character created to represent a user type that might use a site, brand, or product in a particular way.
		- You can use surveys, questionnaires and user testing to make your personas more detailed
		- make sure your personas represent people who are actually interested in purchasing your products and services
		- By now you have a few different personas
		- Narrow your focus on one or two of them
	**Step 3:** List out all the touchpoints
		- Touchpoints are places in your application that your customers can interact with you. It can be a button, a drop-down or a search bar.
	**Step 4:** List out the emotions
		- Next, list all actions corresponding to those touchpoints and the emotions linked with those actions.
		- For example, what does the user feel when they are using the navigation menu. Do they find what they are looking for easily? Do they experience any difficulties in achieving their desired goals?
	**Step 5:** Fix the pain points
		- You need to fix the actions that have negative emotions attached with them to make the user's journey as smooth as possible.
	**Step 6:** Take the customer journey yourself
		- Review the changes you made by involving yourself as the customer
	**Step 7:** Repeat
		- Making a map is an iterative process
		- More iterations give Better results

We have now gained reasonable understanding of customer journey maps. Now here's a customer journey map of Lyft as an example case study. As we can see, customer journey maps make it really easy to point out faults in our product and guide us towards building a better one.

- Example Case Studies
	- (Backend) How using **OAuth** instead of regular authentication leads to more signups
		- [Reference](https://www.clowder.com/post/why-your-organization-should-be-using-oauth-2.0)
		- The average person maintained 27 passwords in 2016, and 30% of help desk calls are related to password reset issues.
		- When logins become cumbersome and users get frustrated, productivity and morale go down.
		- Enabling users to use SSO through OAuth 2.0 eases access, mitigates risks and gives users control over where their data is shared.
